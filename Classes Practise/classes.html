    // Classes

    // NOTES: Classes are NOT a new object-oriented inheritance model in JS, it is syntactical sugar over JS exisiting prototype-based inheritance; it consolidates everything into a Class
    // Notice that the methods in the class below are not separated by commas, this is how the syntax is
    // The below is a class declaration. Classes can be written as named or unnamed expressions too
    // Unlike Function declarations, Class declarations CANNOT be hoisted. The same goes for Class expression too
    class Dog {
      constructor(name, breed) {
        this.name = name;
        this.breed = breed;
      }
      // The methods below are using the shorthand form of functions that is new to ES6
      bark() {
        console.log(`Bark Bark! My name is ${this.name}`);
      }
      cuddle() {
        console.log(`I love you owner!`);
      }
      // Static method
      // Static method can only be used on the class itself, not on any instances of the class
      // I.e. If I invoke - snickers.info() it will not call the information below
      // However, if I call Dog.info() the information will appear as expected as it is called directly
      static info() {
        console.log('Sausage dogs are the best kind of dog!');
      }
      // GETTERS/SETTERS
      // NOTES: These are not new to ES6, however they have been made easier to use and understand

      // SETTERS 
      // 'nicknames' below can be called and a parameter can be passed to it
      // You can then call lucky.nick and it will set the value, in this case it will also trim() any whitespace off what you set
      // i.e. lucky.nicknames = '  doggy    ';
      set nickname(value) {
        this.nick = value.trim();
      }

      // GETTERS
      // NOTE: Getters are NOT a method, but rather a property that is computed when he call on it

      // Getter to set the nickname from the setter above
      // Without this getter the setter of nickname above, would not get returned
      // We are also getting it returned in uppercase
      get nickname() {
        return this.nick.toUpperCase();
      }

      // Getter to set a description
      get description() {
        return `${this.name} is a ${this.breed}, the best type of dog`;
      }


    }

    // Prototype Inheritence
    // function Dog(name, breed) {
    //   this.name = name;
    //   this.breed = breed;
    // }

    // Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
    //   console.log(`Bark Bark! My name is ${this.name}`);
    // };

    // Dog.prototype.cuddle = function() {
    //   console.log(`I love you owner!`);
    // };

    const lucky = new Dog('Lucky', 'Dachshund');
    const sunny = new Dog('Sunny', 'Golden Doodle');
